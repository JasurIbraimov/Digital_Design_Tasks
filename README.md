# Tasks from Digital Design 

Hi, this is an entry tasks from school for front-end-developers "Digital Design"! It's not a projects just a little bunch of code. So I think you'll be not interested by reading those. 
I just hope that this school will check all tasks and give me an answer as soon as they can. Thanks for attention!
